# Named Entity Recognition using a LSTM neural network

This semester project implements a Bidirectional LSTM tagger for named entity recognition as described in Lample et al. Neural Architectures for Named Entity Recognition. NAACL-HLT 2016. (without the CRF layer).The results are evaluated on the CoNLL 2003 dataset and compared to the scores presented in the paper.
