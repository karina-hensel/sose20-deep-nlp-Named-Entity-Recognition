# Named Entity Recognition using a character- and word-based BiLSTM

This semester project implements a Bidirectional LSTM tagger for named entity recognition as described in Lample et al. Neural Architectures for Named Entity Recognition. NAACL-HLT 2016. (without the CRF layer).The results are evaluated on the CoNLL 2003 dataset and compared to the scores presented in the paper.


Due to the large size of the model files, a notebook to verify the results is provided on Kaggle under the following link: www.kaggle.com/dataset/464386cc8fd221bca928180717c20127aad3eafa75251066ed1ab9aea2e225e1
